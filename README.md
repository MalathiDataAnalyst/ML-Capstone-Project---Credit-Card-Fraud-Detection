Data Science Capstone Project: Credit Card Fraud Detection
🎯 Project OverviewThis repository hosts the documentation and external link for the Credit Card Fraud Detection data science project. The main objective was to [briefly describe the main goal, e.g., build a classification model to predict customer response, perform time-series forecasting of stock prices, or cluster customer demographics].The entire analysis, from data ingestion and cleaning to model deployment and visualization, was executed and documented within the associated Google Colab notebook.
🚀 Key Analysis & GoalsThis project focused on the following key phases:Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handling missing data, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing key variable distributions and correlations to understand underlying data patterns.Model Selection & Training: Implementing and comparing different Machine Learning algorithms (e.g., K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) to solve the [Classification/Regression/Clustering] problem.Model Evaluation: Assessing performance using relevant metrics (e.g., Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, RMSE, AUC).
🛠️ Technologies & LibrariesThe analysis was conducted in Python 3 on the Google Colaboratory platform, utilizing the following libraries:CategoryTool/LibraryPurposePlatformGoogle ColaboratoryCloud-based Jupyter environment.Data HandlingpandasData structure and manipulation.Numerical ComputingnumpyAdvanced mathematical operations.Visualizationmatplotlib & seabornCreating static and statistical plots for EDA.Machine Learningscikit-learnImplementing ML models and utility functions.Deep LearningTensorFlow / Keras (if applicable)Building neural network architectures.💡 Key Findings & Model Performance
