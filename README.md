Data Science Capstone Project: Credit Card Fraud Detection

🎯 Project Overview:

This repository hosts the documentation and external link for the Credit Card Fraud Detection data science project. The main objective was to [briefly describe the main goal, e.g., build a classification model to predict customer response, perform time-series forecasting of stock prices, or cluster customer demographics].The entire analysis, from data ingestion and cleaning to model deployment and visualization, was executed and documented within the associated Google Colab notebook.

🚀 Key Analysis & Goals:

This project focused on the following key phases:

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handling missing data, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing key variable distributions and correlations to understand underlying data patterns.

Model Selection & Training: Implementing and comparing different Machine Learning algorithms (e.g., K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) to solve the [Classification/Regression/Clustering] problem.

Model Evaluation: Assessing performance using relevant metrics (e.g., Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, RMSE, AUC).
